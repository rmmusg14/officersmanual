Beginning of the year:
- Co-curricular Extravaganza
- Informational Meeting
- Request funds as soon as possible for informational meeting (or possibly ask Toni if the Classics department could fund this like they did for us this year - by fund we mean provide some refreshments)

Club Emails:
Using the club email is incredibly easy - simply log on to your school email, then click your name in the top right and select "RSO manuscriptsinscriptions..." I believe just the President and Vice President have access, and you don't need to do anything, we were automatically granted access. 

RSO Budget Requests:
Funding requests must be submitted before 4pm on Monday, then you will be contacted to have a meeting on that Wednesday - usually the President and Treasurer attend these meetings (it is helpful to have two people in attendance)
- The RSO is big on having events open to the whole campus, so stress in any way you can the multidisciplinary nature of the club and that it is not just Classics students who attend our events/meetings
- Be sure that the treasurer keeps good track of funds received and spent from the reserve board

First meeting: 
- Workshops on Github and XML
- Make sure someone from the communications committee is taking attendance

Vans:
- To request a van, fill out the form on this page: http://offices.holycross.edu/publicsafety/transportation
- Requests should be made probably a week or more in advance (technically 48 hours is the minimum, but we had problems this year with vans being unavailable being requested on short notice)
- If you need an EZ pass include that in your request
- If you forget, save receipts and take them to Jerry Maday to be reimbursed
- Pick up keys for the van at the public safety booth on Linden Lane
- Vans are in the parking garage (large vans on the 3rd floor, minivans on the 1st [bottom] floor)
- If you need gas, simply drive the van up to the booth on linden lane, they will give you a card to fill up the tank at the gas station right around the corner

Important dates to keep in mind:
- Mid/Late September - Co-curricular Extravaganza
- Early First Semester - Classics Day Manuscripts Challenge
- March - Re-recognition
- April - Club Elections

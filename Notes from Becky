Beginning of the year:
- Co-curricular Extravaganza
- Informational Meeting
- Request funds as soon as possible for informational meeting (or possibly ask Toni if the Classics department could fund this like they did for us this year - by fund we mean provide some refreshments)

Club Emails:
- Using the club email is incredibly easy - simply log on to your school email, then click your name in the top right and select "RSO manuscriptsinscriptions..." I believe just the President and Vice President have access, and you don't need to do anything, we were automatically granted access. 

RSO Budget Requests:
- Funding requests must be submitted before 4pm on Monday, then you will be contacted to have a meeting on that Wednesday - usually the President and Treasurer attend these meetings (it is helpful to have two people in attendance)
- The RSO is big on having events open to the whole campus, so stress in any way you can the interdisciplinary nature of the club and that it is not just Classics students who attend our events/meetings
- Be sure that the treasurer keeps good track of funds received and spent from the reserve board
- Keep a record of all the club's achievements and how many people attend each event
- We weren't granted a fixed budget because we don't have consistent events and spent more money this year than we did last year, but hopefully next Spring if we have a more concrete idea of how much money the club will be spending each year we can request a fixed budget

First meeting(s): 
- Workshops on Github and XML
- Make sure someone from the communications committee is taking attendance throughout the year

Vans:
- To request a van, fill out the form on this page: http://offices.holycross.edu/publicsafety/transportation
- Requests should be made probably a week or more in advance (technically 48 hours is the minimum, but we had problems this year with vans being unavailable being requested on short notice)
- If you need an EZ pass include that in your request
- If you forget, save receipts and take them to Jerry Maday to be reimbursed
- Pick up keys for the van at the public safety booth on Linden Lane
- Vans are in the parking garage (large vans on the 3rd floor, minivans on the 1st [bottom] floor)
- If you need gas, simply drive the van up to the booth on linden lane, they will give you a card to fill up the tank at the gas station right around the corner

Classics Day Manuscripts Challenge:
- Send out manuscripts challenge in February at some point
- See attached file for the challenge we sent out last year
- Choose top 3 of all the submissions, and have them present on Classics Day itself (last year the three groups presented at 9:30 am, before Certamen started, right after the Classics Day Chair welcomes everyone)
- Winners are announced at the awards ceremony that afternoon

Important dates to keep in mind:
- Mid/Late September - Cocurricular Extravaganza
- Early First Semester - Classics Day Manuscripts Challenge
- March - Re-recognition
- April - Club Elections
